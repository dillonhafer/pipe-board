# Pipe Board

Securely send your Mac's clipboard to other Macs

## Information

Pipe Board only works between OSX computers. You must have [key-based SSH access](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2) to the computer that will be receiving your clipboard. All clipboard content is sent securely over an SSH connection.

## Setup/Installation

1. Visit [releases](https://github.com/dillonhafer/pipe-board/releases) to grab the latest build or source code.
2. Once the app is running, click on the :clipboard: on the status bar.
3. Choose "Configure" from the menu.
4. Enter a title, that will show up in the menu, and a computer address (ssh address. i.e `user@example.com`).
5. Click on the :clipboard: on the status bar again, and choose the computer you want to send your clipboard to.
